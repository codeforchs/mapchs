##Dependencies

+ Download and install the appropriate package for your system.

###Ionic

    # Install the latest Cordova and Ionic command-line tools
    $ npm install -g cordova ionic
    
+ Note: iOS development requires Mac OS X. iOS simulator through the Ionic CLI requires the ios-sim npm package, which can be installed with the command sudo npm -g install ios-sim.

If you want more information on getting started with Ionic development, check out the Ionic [Getting Started](http://ionicframework.com/getting-started/) and [Documentation](http://ionicframework.com/docs/) pages.
